Database of female mosquito diversity of Isla del Carmen Campeche, Mexico
This dataset contains data on female mosquito diversity as assessed in Isla del Carmen Campeche, Mexico, over a 12-month sampling period.
Samplings were carried out along three transects in different vegetation types: a modified area by buildings but still containing semideciduous forest native vegetation (BLDSM), an area of a mixture of dominant mangrove and less abundant semideciduous forest vegetation (MGSM); and a mixture of dominant vegetation of semideciduous forest and less abundant mangrove trees (SMMG).
The dataset contains the collection date and time, information on the local climate season, the taxonomic gender and species name of the collected organisms, and the abundance recorded for each of the three collectors (B1, B2, B3).
